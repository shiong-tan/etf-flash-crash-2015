# Regulatory Changes and Reforms

## The Limited Response

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the August 24, 2015 ETF flash crash is how **little substantive regulatory change followed**. Unlike the May 6, 2010 flash crash that prompted creation of LULD rules, the 2015 event produced minimal new SEC regulations or pilot programs.

---

## SEC Analysis (December 2015)

**What the SEC Did:**
- Division of Economic and Risk Analysis published detailed research note
- Documented scale of event (1,278 halts, 471 securities, 302 ETFs)
- Analyzed contributing factors
- Identified problems with:
  - LULD reference price calculations
  - Staggered openings
  - Market maker withdrawal
  - Stop-loss order cascades

**What the SEC Did NOT Do:**
- No major new rules or regulations
- No pilot programs to test alternatives
- No requirements for market maker obligations during stress
- No stop-loss order reforms
- No ETF stress testing mandates

**Why Limited Response:**
- Senate gridlock: SEC operating two commissioners down
- CFTC effectively stalled from meaningful work
- Political environment unfavorable to regulation
- Industry lobbying against structural changes
- Belief that incremental improvements sufficient

## Exchange-Led Voluntary Improvements

**Amendment 10 to LULD Plan (April 2016)**

**Problem Addressed:**
- Reference prices calculated from midpoint of wide bid-ask spreads
- Example: Bid $50, Ask $70 → midpoint $60 reference (but true value $72)
- Garbage-in-garbage-out: reference prices bore no relation to fair value

**Solution:**
- Modified reference price calculation methodology
- Use **prior day's closing price** instead of potentially wide midpoints
- Provides more reliable anchor during stressed openings

**Impact:**
- Reduced worst reference price failures
- But doesn't solve underlying problem (halts still prevent hedging)
- **Incremental improvement, not systemic fix**

---

**Amendment 12 to LULD Plan (September 2016)**

**Problem Addressed:**
- Different exchanges reopened at different times with different procedures
- NYSE Arca used auctions, Nasdaq different method, BATS yet another
- Same security showed different prices on different venues simultaneously
- Coordination failures and confusion

**Solution:**
- Harmonized reopening procedures across exchanges
- Non-primary markets must remain halted if primary market can't reopen within 10 minutes
- Wait for primary market to establish reference price
- Synchronized reopenings reduce fragmentation

**Impact:**
- Better coordination during halt recoveries
- Fewer instances of simultaneous different prices
- Bryan Harkins (Bats Global Markets): "Marked reduction in number of LULD pauses"
- But can't claim elimination of underlying vulnerabilities

---

**NYSE Rule 48 Repealed (2016)**

**What Rule 48 Did:**
- Suspended requirement for designated market makers to disseminate pre-opening price indications
- Ostensibly to speed opening process during volatile conditions
- On Aug 24, invoked before market open

**The Problem:**
- Removed critical price discovery information
- Market participants lost visibility into likely opening prices
- Reduced transparency at worst possible moment

**Repeal Impact:**
- Restored requirement for pre-opening indications
- Maintains information flow even during volatility
- Small but important improvement

---

**Opening Process Improvements**

**Exchanges Collectively:**
- Revised opening auction procedures
- Improved coordination for start-of-day trading
- Enhanced communication between venues
- Better procedures for reopening after halts

**Results:**
- Fewer disorderly openings since 2015
- But hard to evaluate: no comparable stress tests
- Uncertain whether improvements sufficient for another Aug 24-level event

## Notable Absences from Regulatory Response

### No Market Maker Obligations

**The Problem:**
- Market makers and APs can withdraw liquidity with no obligation to maintain markets
- Voluntary participation fragile during stress
- Liquidity vanishes precisely when most needed

**What Wasn't Done:**
- No requirement for minimum quote presence during stress
- No obligations for APs to create/redeem during dislocations
- No backstop liquidity facility
- **Voluntary model unchanged**

**Industry Argument:**
- Forcing market makers to trade during dysfunction would bankrupt them
- Can't require firms to take unlimited losses
- Better to have voluntary participation than none

**Counter-Argument:**
- Other markets have affirmative obligations (e.g., designated market makers on NYSE)
- Could structure incentives: Reduced fees for firms maintaining quotes during stress
- Public utility nature of liquidity provision justifies some obligation

---

### No Stop-Loss Order Reforms

**The Problem:**
- Stop-loss orders converted to market orders at trigger
- Executed 20-40% below trigger prices on Aug 24
- "Protective" mechanisms became instruments of destruction

**What Wasn't Done:**
- No restrictions on stop-loss orders
- No requirements for investor understanding before using stops
- No changes to order handling during gaps
- No mandatory price limits on converted market orders

**What Was Done:**
- Broker education campaigns warning about risks
- Industry guidance to use limit orders instead
- But voluntary, not mandated

**Reasoning:**
- First Amendment concerns about limiting order types
- Belief that education better than regulation
- Industry self-regulation preferred

---

### No ETF Stress Testing Requirements

**The Problem:**
- No requirement to demonstrate ETF resilience under adverse conditions
- No proof that creation/redemption would function during stress
- No testing of market maker capacity

**What Wasn't Done:**
- No stress testing mandate for ETF issuers
- No liquidity stress scenarios
- No demonstration that primary market (creation/redemption) robust
- No proof of AP commitment during dislocations

**What Exists:**
- Mutual fund liquidity rules (more stringent)
- Bank stress tests (post-2008)
- But ETFs largely exempt from comparable requirements

---

### No Creation/Redemption Mechanism Strengthening

**The Problem:**
- Primary market failed on Aug 24 when APs withdrew
- Arbitrage mechanism broke down completely
- No backstop when voluntary participation fails

**What Wasn't Done:**
- No strengthening of AP commitments
- No requirement for multiple APs per ETF
- No regulatory backstop for creation/redemption
- No minimum capital requirements for APs
- **Fundamental mechanism unchanged**

---

### No Consolidated Audit Trail

**The Problem:**
- Incomplete visibility into trading across fragmented markets
- Difficult to reconstruct what happened in real-time
- SEC lacks tools to monitor and intervene during crises

**Status in 2015-2016:**
- Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) proposed after 2010
- **Still not operational by 2016**
- Delayed repeatedly
- Remained incomplete years after Aug 24

**Consequence:**
- Limited ability to detect problems in real-time
- Post-event analysis difficult
- Can't intervene during developing crises

---

### No Short Selling Reforms

**The Evidence:**
- 279 of 500 S&P 500 companies experienced >50% short selling volume
- Questions about proper share locates and delivery requirements
- In final hour of Aug 25 (as markets fell further), short selling accounted for 36% vs 18% in first hour

**What Wasn't Done:**
- No tightening of short sale locate requirements
- No additional restrictions during volatility
- No enhanced reporting or disclosure
- **No reforms despite extreme activity**

---

## Focus on Education Over Regulation

### Broker/Advisor Education

**What Brokers Did:**
- Client education campaigns on order types
- Warnings about stop-loss risks during volatility
- Guidance to use limit orders
- Emphasis that ETFs should be long-term holdings, not trading vehicles

**Effectiveness:**
- Some retail behavior changed (fewer stop-loss orders)
- But education doesn't fix market structure
- 40% dislocations in major ETFs remain possible
- **Addresses symptoms, not causes**

### Investor Guidance

**Common Advice Post-Aug 24:**
1. Use limit orders instead of market orders
2. Avoid stop-loss orders (use stop-limit if must use stops)
3. Don't trade during first/last 30 minutes
4. Understand ETF mechanics before investing
5. Recognize that ETFs can dislocate from NAV

**The Problem:**
- Places burden on individual investors to protect themselves
- Assumes retail investors have sophistication to navigate dysfunction
- Doesn't fix underlying market structure problems
- **"Caveat emptor" approach to systemic risk**

---

## Industry Pushback Against Retail "Blame"

### The Narrative Battle

**Industry Initially Blamed Retail:**
- "Unsophisticated investors caused crash with market orders"
- "Stop-loss orders triggered cascade"
- Implied market structure was fine, retail behavior was problem

**SEC Strongly Rebutted (Comment Letters):**
> "It is hard to fathom how retail investors could have caused 317 ETPs to trigger circuit breakers and a trillion dollar decline in the U.S. markets from just placing market orders."

**Real Problems Identified:**
- **Off-exchange trading** reducing displayed liquidity (40%+ of volume)
- **Market maker internalization** creating disincentives for limit orders
- **OTC market makers stepping ahead** of public markets for minimal (1/100th cent) price improvement
- **Market structure**, not retail behavior, was root cause

---

## Political and Regulatory Context

**Why Limited Response:**

**1. Regulatory Capture:**
- Financial industry lobbying against structural changes
- Exchanges oppose costly modifications
- Market makers resist obligations

**2. Political Gridlock:**
- SEC operating with commissioner vacancies
- CFTC stalled by Senate
- Partisan disagreements on regulatory approach

**3. Belief in Incremental Improvement:**
- Amendments 10 and 12 seen as sufficient
- Philosophy: Tweak rules, don't overhaul system
- Faith in market self-correction

**4. No Widespread Public Outrage:**
- Unlike 2008 crisis, limited public attention
- Mostly affected sophisticated/wealthy investors
- Political pressure for reform minimal

**5. Industry Reassurance:**
- "We've learned lessons and improved voluntarily"
- "This was one-time perfect storm"
- "Additional regulation would harm market quality"

---

## What Other Experts Said

**Dave Nadig (ETF Expert, August 2016):**
> "In terms of actual regulatory change, not much has changed since August 24th last year... It's impossible to rule out another flash crash and extreme price volatility."

**Market Structure Analysts:**
- "Flash crashes occurring with increasing frequency"
- "Underlying fragility not only remains but may be worsening"
- "Liquidity illusion continues to mislead investors"

**Academic Researchers:**
- Circuit breakers mask problems rather than solve them
- Voluntary liquidity provision inherently fragile
- Need structural reforms, not just incremental improvements

---

## Comparison to May 6, 2010 Response

**May 6, 2010 Flash Crash:**
- Led to creation of **Limit Up-Limit Down rules**
- Single-stock circuit breakers replaced with coordinated approach
- Significant regulatory response
- New market-wide safeguards

**August 24, 2015 Flash Crash:**
- Led to **Amendments 10 and 12** (minor tweaks)
- Rule 48 repealed
- Education campaigns
- **Minimal structural changes**

**Why the Difference:**
- 2010: Novel, shocking, broad market crash
- 2015: ETF-specific, somewhat anticipated given 2010 event
- 2010: Political will for reform still strong post-2008 crisis
- 2015: Regulatory fatigue, gridlock, industry pushback

---

## International Perspective

**European Regulators:**
- Watched U.S. events closely
- Some countries implemented stricter ETF rules
- But U.S. as largest ETF market sets global tone
- Limited international coordination

**Lessons Not Fully Learned:**
- Same market structure vulnerabilities exist globally
- Fragmentation issues in European markets
- Voluntary liquidity provision worldwide
- **Global systemic risk remains**

---

## Assessment: Adequate or Inadequate?

**Arguments for "Adequate":**
- Amendments 10 and 12 addressed worst reference price problems
- No repeat of Aug 24-scale event since 2015
- Market participants learned and adapted
- Education reduced risky behavior

**Arguments for "Inadequate":**
- Fundamental vulnerabilities unchanged
- Voluntary liquidity provision still fragile
- Circuit breakers still can amplify problems
- No stress testing requirements
- No consolidated audit trail operational
- Another Aug 24 entirely possible
- **Treated symptoms, not disease**

**Most Expert Opinion:**
- Incremental improvements helpful but insufficient
- Systemic fragility remains
- "We will likely see a lot more of these unfortunate stories in the next year or two"
- **Question not if it will happen again, but when**
