## Exchange-Traded Funds Basics
- Investment fund that trades on stock exchanges like individual stocks
- Holds basket of underlying securities (stocks, bonds, commodities)
- Price fluctuates throughout trading day (unlike mutual funds)
- Combines diversification of funds with real-time trading of stocks

## NAV vs iNAV: Two Ways to Value an ETF

**NAV (Net Asset Value)**
- Calculated once daily at 4:00 PM ET market close
- Sum market value of all holdings, subtract liabilities, divide by shares outstanding
- Official "true value" used for end-of-day accounting
- Settlement value for creation/redemption transactions

**iNAV (Intraday Indicative Value)**
- Real-time fair value estimate, updated every 15 seconds
- Uses last available price for each security in basket
- Multiplies by shares held, sums all components including cash
- Divides by creation unit size (typically 25,000-100,000 ETF shares)
- **Critical flaw**: Relies on current prices—breaks down when underlying securities are halted

## Dual Market Structure

**Primary Market (Creation/Redemption)**
- Authorized participants (APs) create or redeem ETF shares
- Occurs once daily around 4:00 PM ET
- In-kind exchange: deliver basket of securities, receive ETF shares
- Large minimum sizes: creation units worth $2.5-10 million
- Keeps ETF price aligned with NAV through arbitrage

**Secondary Market (Exchange Trading)**
- Continuous trading on stock exchanges during market hours
- Cash transactions between investors
- Any share quantity (1 share or millions)
- Real-time price discovery through supply and demand
- Where most retail investors buy/sell

## Creation Units
- Minimum size for creating or redeeming ETF shares
- Typically 25,000-100,000 ETF shares per unit
- Total value: $2.5-10 million depending on ETF price
- Only authorized participants can transact in creation units
- Designed for institutional-scale arbitrage activity

## Why This Matters for August 24, 2015
- When iNAV calculations relied on stale prices (halted stocks), fair value became unknown
- When both primary and secondary markets broke simultaneously, prices became untethered
- Understanding dual market structure explains why 40% ETF dislocations were possible
- Creation/redemption mechanism is not automatic—APs withdraw when arbitrage is too risky
