## How to Use These Resources

### For Self-Study

1. **Try the exercises first** - Work through `notebooks/core/03-hands-on-exercises.ipynb` on your own
2. **Check specific solutions** - If stuck on a particular exercise, consult the solutions notebook
3. **Verify your outputs** - Compare your results with the answer key
4. **Read the analysis** - Solutions include detailed explanations of why certain outcomes occurred

### For Instructors

1. **Solutions notebook** - Use as a reference for grading or live coding demonstrations
2. **Answer key** - Provide to students after they complete exercises
3. **Modify as needed** - Solutions are designed to be adapted for different learning contexts

### For Code Review

1. **Compare approaches** - See if your solution is more efficient/elegant than the provided one
2. **Learn best practices** - Solutions follow Python and financial modeling conventions
3. **Understand trade-offs** - Comments explain design decisions

## Important Notes

### Solutions vs. Student Notebooks

| Feature | Student Version | Solutions Version |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Code completeness | `# YOUR CODE HERE` placeholders | Complete working code |
| Outputs | Not executed | Pre-executed with outputs |
| Analysis | Questions only | Detailed answers |
| Purpose | Learning by doing | Reference/verification |

### Academic Integrity

**For Students:**
- Try exercises on your own first
- Use solutions to verify your understanding, not to copy
- Learning happens when you struggle with the problem

**For Instructors:**
- Solutions are publicly available (GitHub)
- Consider modifying parameters or adding new requirements for assessments
- Focus on understanding concepts, not exact code replication
