# Lasting Lessons

## The Core Insight

The August 24, 2015 ETF flash crash revealed a fundamental truth: **market structure designed for normal conditions can amplify rather than dampen stress**. Even the largest, most liquid ETFs tracking the most mainstream indices can dislocate 30-40% from fair value when multiple safeguards fail simultaneously.

---

## Ongoing Market Vulnerabilities

### 1. Market Maker Withdrawal Risk Persists

**The Problem:**
- Liquidity provision is voluntary, not obligatory
- Market makers withdraw when hedging impossible or risk too high
- Precisely when liquidity most needed, it vanishes

**Still True Today:**
- No regulatory obligation imposed after Aug 24
- Same conditions that caused 2015 withdrawal could recur
- **APs can still step away from creation/redemption arbitrage**

**Implications:**
- Don't assume liquidity always available
- "Deep" markets can become illiquid instantly
- Size provides no protection (even $65B IVV dislocated)

---

### 2. Circuit Breakers Still Mask Problems

**What LULD Does Well:**
- Prevents erroneous trades far from fair value
- Provides brief pauses during volatility

**What LULD Does Poorly:**
- Stops trading when markets need price discovery most
- Prevents hedging, making market-making impossible
- 5-minute information blackouts increase uncertainty
- Brief 15-30 second trading windows insufficient for rational price formation

**Post-2015 Improvements:**
- Amendment 10: Better reference price calculation
- Amendment 12: Harmonized reopening procedures
- **But fundamental tension remains:** Halts stop trading but don't create liquidity

**Could Happen Again:**
- Flash crashes occurring with "increasing frequency" per analysts
- Same cascading halt pattern possible
- ETFs could spend more time halted than trading
- **Circuit breakers remain symptom masker, not solution**

---

### 3. ETF Structural Fragility Unchanged

**Dual Market Dependency:**
- Primary market (creation/redemption) at 4 PM
- Secondary market (exchange trading) opens 9:30 AM
- **Temporal gap exploitable when underlying prices unknown**

**Creation/Redemption Mechanism:**
- Voluntary AP participation
- When APs withdraw, mechanism fails
- RSP at $50 vs $71 iNAV shows breakdown
- **No backstop when arbitrage too risky**

**iNAV Calculation Weakness:**
- Depends on current prices of all constituents
- When stocks halted, relies on stale data
- Fair value becomes unknowable
- **Garbage in, garbage out**

**Size Irrelevant:**
- IVV ($65B), RSP ($9.5B), even SPY vulnerable
- "Low volatility" ETFs experienced extreme volatility
- Mainstream S&P 500 products dislocated 26-43%
- **If these can fail, what can't?**

---

### 4. Opening Process Remains Vulnerable

**First 15 Minutes:**
- Least liquidity, highest volatility
- Widest LULD bands (±10% vs ±5% regular trading)
- Paradoxically, wider bands = more halts on Aug 24
- Staggered stock openings prevent coherent ETF pricing
- **Still the most dangerous time to trade**

**Weekend Order Buildup:**
- Friday close to Monday open allows sentiment to shift
- Order imbalances accumulate
- Aug 24 was Monday after volatile week
- **Same pattern could repeat**

**Rule 48 Repealed But:**
- Other transparency issues remain
- Pre-opening indications helpful but not sufficient
- Coordination challenges across exchanges persist

---

### 5. Systemic Interconnections Create Contagion

**Cross-Product Linkages:**
- ETFs → underlying stocks → futures → options → swaps
- Problem in any leg propagates instantly
- E-Mini futures limit down → no ETF hedging
- ETF dislocations → forced selling of underlying
- **Tight coupling amplifies shocks**

**Concentration Risk:**
- Few firms dominate market making (Jane Street, Citadel, Virtu)
- If even Jane Street must withdraw, who provides liquidity?
- Single points of failure
- **Concentration creates systemic vulnerability**

**Global Markets:**
- Asian selloff → European stress → U.S. chaos
- 24/7 markets mean overnight gaps
- International correlation increases during crises
- **Contagion can start anywhere**

## Practical Investor Lessons

### Order Types: Life or Death Decisions

**Stop-Loss Orders:**
- ✗ Convert to market orders (no price protection)
- ✗ Execute 20-40% below trigger during gaps
- ✗ Protective mechanism becomes destructive
- **Lesson: Don't use stop-loss orders on ETFs**

**Market Orders:**
- ✗ "Any price" execution
- ✗ Fall through order book air pockets
- ✗ Catastrophic during volatility
- **Lesson: Never use market orders during first/last 30 minutes**

**Limit Orders:**
- ✓ Price protection guaranteed
- ✓ Won't execute at unacceptable prices
- ✓ Better to hold -5% position than force sell at -31%
- **Lesson: Always use limit orders for ETFs**

**Stop-Limit Orders:**
- ✓ Trigger converts to limit (not market)
- ✓ Downside price protection
- ⚠ May not execute if gap too severe
- **Lesson: If must use stops, use stop-limit**

---

### ETF Behavior During Stress

**What Aug 24 Taught:**

1. **ETF Price ≠ Fair Value During Crises**
   - Can trade 38% below NAV
   - Even for large, liquid, mainstream products
   - Size and trading volume provide no protection

2. **"Low Volatility" Labels Meaningless**
   - SPLV dropped 46% despite name
   - Product marketing doesn't prevent dislocations
   - Judge by market structure, not marketing claims

3. **Liquidity is Illusion**
   - Appears deep during normal conditions
   - Vanishes precisely when needed
   - Can't assume ability to exit large positions

4. **Recovery Doesn't Help Forced Sellers**
   - RSP recovered $50 → $71 within hour
   - But stop-loss sellers locked in 30% losses
   - Temporary dislocation = permanent wealth transfer

5. **Mainstream is No Safer Than Niche**
   - S&P 500 ETFs dislocated as much as exotic products
   - Index tracking doesn't prevent price failures
   - Conservative portfolios suffered worst

---

### Timing and Behavior

**High-Risk Periods:**
- ✗ First 30 minutes of trading day
- ✗ Last 30 minutes of trading day
- ✗ Around major economic data releases
- ✗ Earnings announcements
- ✗ After weekend/holiday (order buildup)
- ✗ Known volatility events (Fed decisions, elections)

**Lower-Risk Periods:**
- ✓ Mid-morning to mid-afternoon
- ✓ Normal market conditions
- ✓ High liquidity environments
- ✓ When iNAV and price aligned

**Behavioral Guidelines:**
- **Don't panic sell** during obvious dislocations
- **Monitor iNAV** to identify mispricings
- **Be patient** during temporary stress
- **Use volatility** to buy at discounts if confident in fair value
- **Have cash reserve** to take advantage of dislocations

---

## For Financial Professionals

### Advisor Responsibilities

**Due Diligence:**
- Research ETF market-making coverage
- Evaluate bid-ask spreads (not just expense ratios)
- Check creation/redemption activity
- Understand underlying market liquidity
- **Don't treat all ETFs as equivalent**

**Client Education:**
- Explain ETF mechanics before recommending
- Discuss Aug 24 as case study
- Set realistic expectations about stress behavior
- Document client understanding
- **Fiduciary duty includes market structure education**

**Order Handling:**
- Mandate limit orders for client accounts
- Ban or severely restrict stop-loss orders
- Avoid first/last 30 minutes
- Position size limits on individual ETFs
- **Protect clients from themselves**

---

### Institutional Risk Management

**Portfolio Construction:**
- Diversify across multiple ETFs (not single large position)
- Consider underlying liquidity, not just ETF volume
- Plan for potential 20-40% intraday dislocations
- **Stress test portfolios for ETF-specific shocks**

**Trading Protocols:**
- Use algorithms for large orders (VWAP/TWAP)
- Negotiate block trades upfront
- Monitor iNAV during execution
- Have standing liquidity arrangements
- **Don't assume market orders will work for large sizes**

**Crisis Management:**
- Pre-planned protocols for extreme volatility
- Decision trees for when to hold vs liquidate
- Authority limits for real-time decisions
- Post-mortem processes after events
- **Preparation prevents panic**

## Systemic Lessons for Market Structure

### What We Learned About Market Design

**1. Voluntary Liquidity is Fragile**
- Market-based liquidity provision breaks during stress
- No obligation = rational withdrawal
- Public utility function (liquidity) with private incentives (profit)
- **Misalignment creates systemic risk**

**2. Circuit Breakers Have Costs**
- Prevent bad prints but also prevent hedging
- Information vacuums increase uncertainty
- Brief trading windows insufficient
- **Safety mechanism can amplify problems**

**3. Fair Value Calculation Critical**
- iNAV unreliable when inputs stale
- Need robust pricing even when stocks halted
- Multiple cross-references necessary
- **Price discovery infrastructure matters**

**4. Hedging Access Essential**
- Market makers need functioning underlying markets
- Simultaneous halts across related products problematic
- Alternative hedging tools must remain available
- **Liquidity providers need tools to manage risk**

**5. Complexity Creates Fragility**
- ETF dual market structure
- Fragmented exchanges
- Off-exchange trading
- Algorithmic interdependencies
- **Tightly coupled systems amplify shocks**

---

## What Hasn't Changed (And Should)

### Regulatory Gaps

**Still Missing:**
- ✗ Market maker obligations during stress
- ✗ ETF stress testing requirements
- ✗ Creation/redemption mechanism strengthening
- ✗ Stop-loss order restrictions
- ✗ Consolidated audit trail (still incomplete years later)
- ✗ Coordinated halt procedures
- ✗ Fair value calculation standards for stress

**Why It Matters:**
- Same vulnerabilities exposed Aug 24 still exist
- Next crisis could be worse
- Regulatory gaps = systemic risk
- **Question not "if" but "when"**

---

### Expert Predictions

**Dave Nadig (2016):**
> "It's impossible to rule out another flash crash and extreme price volatility... we will likely see a lot more of these unfortunate stories in the next year or two."

**Market Structure Analysts:**
- Flash crashes "occurring with increasing frequency"
- Underlying fragility "not only remains but may be worsening"
- Liquidity illusion "continues to mislead investors"

**Academic Research:**
- Circuit breakers insufficient
- Voluntary liquidity inherently unstable
- Need structural reforms, not incremental improvements

---

## The Big Picture

### What August 24, 2015 Really Taught Us

**1. Market Structure Matters More Than Product Quality**
- ETF issuers held correct securities
- NAV calculations were accurate
- Funds operated exactly as designed
- **But market structure failure caused 40% dislocations anyway**

**2. Apparent Safeguards Can Backfire**
- Stop-loss "protection" caused catastrophic losses
- Circuit breakers amplified problems
- Market fragmentation reduced transparency
- **Good intentions + poor design = worse outcomes**

**3. Size and Liquidity Are No Protection**
- $65B IVV, $10B RSP both failed
- Most liquid products became illiquid
- Mainstream indices as vulnerable as exotic
- **Systemic failures don't discriminate**

**4. Voluntary Cooperation Fails Under Stress**
- Market makers rationally withdrew
- APs correctly avoided unhedgeable "arbitrage"
- Individual rationality = collective fragility
- **Need structural solutions, not hope**

**5. Education Can't Fix Structure**
- Informing investors about order types helps individual outcomes
- But doesn't prevent systemic dislocations
- "Caveat emptor" insufficient for market-wide failures
- **Individual prudence can't solve systemic problems**

---

## Looking Forward

### Probability of Recurrence

**High-Risk Scenarios:**
- Overnight global shock (geopolitical, pandemic, financial crisis)
- Weekend order buildup
- Monday opening after volatile Friday
- Multiple exchanges/markets disrupted simultaneously
- Algorithmic trading malfunction
- **Any combination of Aug 24 factors**

**Warning Signs:**
- Futures limit up/down
- Asian/European markets in turmoil
- Pre-market bid-ask spreads extremely wide
- News of exchange/trading system problems
- Market maker announcements of withdrawal

**What to Do:**
- Recognize high-risk environment
- Avoid trading during opening period
- Use limit orders exclusively
- Monitor iNAV vs price
- Be prepared for temporary dislocations
- **Have plan before crisis, not during**

---

### How to Prepare

**For Individual Investors:**
1. Understand ETF mechanics and vulnerabilities
2. Always use limit orders for ETFs
3. Never use stop-loss orders
4. Avoid trading first/last 30 minutes
5. Maintain cash reserve for opportunities
6. Don't panic sell during dislocations
7. Monitor iNAV during volatility

**For Advisors:**
1. Client education on ETF risks
2. Documented order handling protocols
3. Position limits on individual ETFs
4. Regular stress scenario discussions
5. Crisis communication plans

**For Institutions:**
1. Stress test portfolios for ETF shocks
2. Pre-negotiated liquidity arrangements
3. Real-time iNAV monitoring systems
4. Authority limits for crisis decisions
5. Post-event review processes

---

## The Ultimate Lesson

**August 24, 2015 demonstrated that:**
- Modern market structure is fragile
- Multiple safeguards can fail simultaneously
- Even the largest, most liquid products vulnerable
- Voluntary liquidity provision unreliable during stress
- Individual prudence necessary but insufficient

**The fundamental question remains unanswered:**
- If $65B S&P 500 ETF can dislocate 26% in minutes
- If stop-loss "protection" can increase losses 2x
- If circuit breakers can amplify rather than dampen volatility
- If market makers must withdraw when liquidity most needed
- **How do we build resilient market structure for next crisis?**

**The honest answer:**
- We largely haven't
- Incremental improvements helpful but insufficient
- Fundamental vulnerabilities remain
- **Another August 24 is not a question of "if" but "when"**

**Be prepared.**
