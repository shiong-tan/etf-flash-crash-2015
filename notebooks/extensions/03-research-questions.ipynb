    "### Good Research Includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear question**: Well-defined, specific, answerable\n",
    "2. **Literature review**: What do we already know?\n",
    "3. **Testable hypotheses**: Predictions that can be falsified\n",
    "4. **Rigorous methodology**: Justified assumptions, appropriate methods\n",
    "5. **Sensitivity analysis**: Test how results change with assumptions\n",
    "6. **Honest limitations**: What doesn't your analysis capture?\n",
    "7. **Clear presentation**: Visualizations, tables, narrative\n",
    "8. **Actionable insights**: So what? What should change?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HARKing**: Hypothesizing After Results are Known\n",
    "- **Cherry-picking**: Only showing favorable results\n",
    "- **P-hacking**: Trying many tests until something is \"significant\"\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: Models that work on your data but not generally\n",
    "- **Ignoring trade-offs**: Every solution has costs\n",
    "- **Unrealistic assumptions**: Models must connect to reality\n",
